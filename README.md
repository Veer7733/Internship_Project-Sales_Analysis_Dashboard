## Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy (For Data Cleaning)
- **Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Data Format:** CSV / Excel

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and duplicates.  
   - Converted data types (especially dates).  
   - Removed irrelevant columns and formatted data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Identified top-selling products and regions.  
   - Analyzed monthly sales trends.  
   - Visualized category performance and courier status.

3. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Built KPIs: Total Sales, Total Quantity, Average Order Value.  
   - Added charts for category, region, and time-based performance.  
   - Enabled multiple interactive filters for dynamic analysis.

## Key Insights 

- **Total Sales:** ₹76.14M from 120K orders (avg ₹590/order) — strong and steady performance.  
- **Top Month:** April (₹27.91M) saw peak sales; gradual dip after suggests seasonal impact.  
- **Top Regions:** Maharashtra & Karnataka lead (30%+ orders); North & East India show potential.  
- **Top Categories:** “Set” (54.7%) and “Kurta” (29.8%) drive most revenue.  
- **Fulfilment:** 90% shipped successfully; 5% unshipped/cancelled due to minor issues.  
- **Key Insight:** Over-reliance on “Set” category — diversify and replicate April’s successful strategy.  

## Recommendations 

- Expand marketing to **North & East India**.  
- Promote **underperforming categories** (Dupatta, Bottom, Ethnic Dress).  
- **Diversify** product mix beyond “Set” and Kurta.  
- Improve fulfilment by addressing **unshipped/cancelled orders**.  
- Introduce **offers, combos, and loyalty programs** to retain customers.
